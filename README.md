# ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¼ Malawi District Graph Visualization

This project visualizes Malawiâ€™s 28 districts as a graph, where each node represents a district and each edge represents a neighboring (adjacent) district. The layout is computed using a force-directed algorithm and rendered using D3.js.

There are **two approaches** available in this project:

---

## Two Approaches

### ðŸ”¹ 1. `simple_js/` â€“ Static HTML + JavaScript

- Uses plain JavaScript and D3.js
- Runs a Node.js script (`forceLayout.js`) to generate `output.json` from `data.json`
- Displays the graph in `index.html` using D3.js

Details: [`simple_js/README.md`](./simple_js/README.md)

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. `react/` â€“ React App with Upload & Optimization

- Built using React and D3.js
- Allows uploading your own `.json` graph file via a file input
- Includes a button to optimize and re-render the layout interactively in the browser

Details: [`react/README.md`](./react/README.md)
